This is a Information Retrival Project which uses uniword indexes and employs Ranked retrival techniques to match the query and get the results.

It is implemented in Hadoop and uses Map Reduce to do a distrubuted search.

This project was tested on Palmetto Cluster using 8 nodes and 16 cores.

I have uploaded ppt which has further details on design.
